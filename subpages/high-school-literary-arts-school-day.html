<p class="o-lead">High school classrooms connect with contemporary and classic literature by attending readings and meetings with featured authors presented in this new program.</p>
<!--<p><a class="u-link" href="/young-leaders/student-anthology">Read past student work in the 92NY digital student anthologies</a>.</p> -->

<p>Classes enrolled in this season&rsquo;s program will explore the work of <strong>Richard Blanco</strong>, the fifth Presidential Inaugural Poet and 2023 National Humanities Medal Awardee, with a special focus on the recent release of Blanco&rsquo;s most recent collection of poetry: <em>Homeland Of My Body</em>, which reassess traditional notions of home as strictly a geographical, tangible place that merely exist outside us, but rather, within us.</p>

<blockquote class="o-blockquote">
<p>&ldquo;An engineer, poet, Cuban American, Richard Blanco&rsquo;s poetry bridges cultures and languages&mdash;a mosaic of our past, our present, and our future&mdash;reflecting a nation that is hectic, colorful, and still becoming.&rdquo;</p>
<cite>President Joe Biden, conferring the National Humanities Medal on Richard Blanco, 2023</cite></blockquote>
