						In recognition of a generous gift from the Amber Walker Estate in

					<p>
						Chris was a longtime volunteer at the Poetry Center, making
						transcriptions of audio recordings from our archive that were models
						of their kind. This gift honors his commitment to the belief that
						widespread access to great literature can change young
