    <h2>Afro-Latin Percussion (Grades K-12)</h2>

    <p>
      Students explore the art of Afro-Latin percussion, learning a variety of
      rhythms &mdash; playable on their djembe drums, provided by 92NY &mdash;
      as well as the cultural practices surrounding these rhythms, key artists
      in their respective genres, and historical events that defined the rhythms
      and musical development. Students practice a variety of basic
      sound-producing techniques, such as the open tone, bass tone, heel-toe
      variation, slap, and finger strokes.
    </p>

    <h2>House and Hip Hop Dance (Grades 2-12)</h2>

    <p>
      Students learn the movement fundamentals of hip hop dance and are
      introduced to the early diasporic historical roots of hip hop in America,
      exploring the form as a vehicle for personal and community expression.
    </p>

    <h2>Visual Art (Grades K-12)</h2>

    <p>
      Students explore the artistic process and express their own creativity
      through hands-on residencies led by expert 92NY Teaching Artists. Past
      residencies have focused on a variety of disciplines, including ceramics,
      mixed-media collage, and sculpture. Residencies can be customized to
      reflect the needs and capacity of the school&rsquo;s community and
      facility.
    </p>

    <h2>Chorus (Grades 2-12)</h2>

    <p>
      Students develop their vocal technique, expand their musical repertoire,
      and develop a love of music. Led by an expert 92NY Teaching Artist,
      students will gain and demonstrate a basic knowledge of technical singing
      and musical vocabulary, and the ensemble will perform a diverse program of
      traditional and non-traditional choral repertoire.
    </p>

    <h2>Creative Movement (PreK-Grade 1)</h2>

    <p>
      Aligned with early childhood development fundamentals, students learn the
      basic elements of dance, develop body awareness, and demonstrate an
      understanding of personal and shared space. Students will harness their
      imagination to support the embodiment of skills and explore the role that
      dance plays in their own lives and cultures and explore the role that
      dance plays in their own lives and cultures.
