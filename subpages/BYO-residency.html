		<h2>Afro-Latin Percussion</h2>

		<p>
			Students explore the art of Afro-Latin percussion, learning a variety of
			rhythms — playable on their djembe drums, provided by 92NY — as well as
			the cultural practices surrounding these rhythms, key artists in their
			respective genres, and historical events that defined the rhythms and
			musical development. Students practice a variety of basic sound-producing
			techniques, such as the open tone, bass tone, heel-toe variation, slap,
			and finger strokes.
		</p>

		<h2>House and Hip Hop Dance</h2>

		<p>
			Students learn the movement fundamentals of hip hop dance and are
			introduced to the early diasporic historical roots of hip hop in America,
			exploring the form as a vehicle for personal and community expression.
		</p>

		<h2>Visual Art</h2>

		<p>
			Students explore the artistic process and express their own creativity
			through hands-on residencies led by expert 92NY Teaching Artists. Past
			residencies have focused on a variety of disciplines, including ceramics,
			mixed-media collage, and sculpture. Residencies can be customized to
			reflect the needs and capacity of the school's community and facility.
