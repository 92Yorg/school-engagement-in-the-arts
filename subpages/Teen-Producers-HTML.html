<h2>About</h2>

<div class="s-prose">
<p>Teen Producers invites rising juniors from New York City public high schools to gain technical, curatorial, and leadership skills through a two-year internship at The 92nd Street Y, New York (92NY).</p>

<h3>Program Components</h3>

<h5>Internship Placement</h5>

<p>Teen Producers participate in a weekly internship, working directly with 92NY’s Center for Arts Learning & Leadership, as well as collaborating with departments across the organization. The internship enables teens to gain hands-on workforce experience, establish a professional network in the field, and use their individual and collective voice to influence program design at 92NY.</p>

<h5>Classes and Private Study</h5>

<p>Participating teens have the opportunity to develop their technique in their chosen art forms through yearlong classes and private study with faculty in 92NY’s School of the Arts, Music, and Dance. 92NY covers all costs associated with classes and private study.</p>

<h5>College- and Career-Readiness</h5>

<p>Teen Producers work one-on-one with a college advisor during the college identification and application process, helping them through the financial aid process, the Common Application, and their personal statements. Participating teens also explore career readiness best practices through supplementary workshops and opportunities.</p>

<h5>Attendance at Cultural Arts Events</h5>

<p>Teen Producers attend a range of performances and exhibitions at 92NY and other NYC-based arts organizations. 92NY covers all costs associated with attendance at events, including tickets and transportation.</p>

<h5>Culminating Production &mdash; Teen Arts Week</h5>

<p>Teen Producers will use their respective knowledge, strengths, and skill sets to help produce <em>Teen Arts Week</em>, NYC’s annual citywide celebration of the arts &mdash; for teens, by teens &mdash; including the Teen Arts Week Kickoff Event at 92NY. </p>

</figure>

<p><strong>Patricia (0:01):</strong> We are back on &quot;Digital Edition New York&quot;. Despite the fact that it is sometimes considered the art capitol of the world, New York sometimes lacks diverse representation.</p>

<p><strong>Rafael (0:11):</strong> This may change because 92Y&rsquo;s program seeks to change the perspective. To learn more we have Ricardo Maldonado, who is the program director of poetry and Susan Domínguez who is a student participant in this initiative. Welcome! Tell us what this is all about?</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo (0:32): </strong> Well, 92Y is a cultural center in the Upper East Side. We have been there for more than 140 years and have had programs for our community and for the world. The program, &ldquo;Teen Producers&rdquo;, is for Bronx public school students, where they work with us in a professional exploration program in which they are also able to develop their talents.</p>

<p><strong>Patricia (1:02):</strong> How great! Susan, you are a participant and an example of what this program has achieved on a cultural level. Tell us about your experience.</p>

<p><strong>Susan (1:10):</strong> My experience in the program has been great, because it has helped me to have an appreciation for what has to happen before going on stage.</p>

<p><strong>Rafael (1:23):</strong> Basically, it&rsquo;s as if it were a preliminary preparation so that when we arrive at the stage we know what the challenges are, and the preparation you have to do.</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo (1:34):</strong> Exactly! For example, Susan comes every week and she works with the sales department, promotions and marketing. We are creating a program that in one week&mdash;two weeks is your own.</p>

<p><strong>Patricia (1:51):</strong> But it&rsquo;s not only acting, its music, its all types of beautiful poetry. Having poetry, and bringing children closer to poetry, it seems amazing. How would I, if I lived in the Bronx, get in contact with you all?</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo (2:05):</strong> That&rsquo;s a great question! The program works with certain schools that are collaborating with us. They talk with their teachers and request to join the program.</p>

<p><strong>Rafael (2:16):</strong> Only specific schools?</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo (2:19):</strong> Yes, only certain schools.</p>

<p><strong>Rafael (2:20):</strong> And all of the schools have the same benefits?</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo (2:22):</strong> Yes, they all have the same program.</p>

<p><strong>Rafael (2:23):</strong> And how much does it cost?</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo (2:24):</strong> It does not cost anyone, anything! And it is for communities in need.</p>

<p><strong>Rafael (2:28):</strong> Really, they should take advantage of this program because it is free. So, to know which schools are participating is there a page?</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo (2:34):</strong> Yes, you can visit our website, 92Y.org/edoutreach.</p>

<p><strong>Patricia (2:40):</strong> I suppose, that there we&rsquo;ll find all the requirements and information for those who want to know more. Thank you very much for this initiative that is so great and helpful to our children to learn about the art, poetry, music and culture.</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo (2:48):</strong> Thank you!</p>
