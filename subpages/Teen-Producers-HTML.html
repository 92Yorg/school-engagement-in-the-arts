					<h2>About</h2>

					<div class="s-prose">
						<p>
							Teen Producers invites rising juniors from New York City public
							high schools to gain technical, curatorial, and leadership skills
							through a paid two-year internship at The 92nd Street Y, New York
							(92NY).
						</p>

						<h3>Program Components</h3>

						<h5>Internship Placement</h5>

						<p>
							Teen Producers participate in a paid weekly internship, working
							directly with 92NY&rsquo;s Center for Arts Learning &amp;
							Leadership, as well as collaborating with departments across the
							organization. The internship enables teens to gain hands-on
							workforce experience, establish a professional network in the
							field, and use their individual and collective voice to influence
							program design at 92NY.
						</p>

						<h5>Classes and Private Study</h5>

						<p>
							Participating teens have the opportunity to develop their
							technique in their chosen art forms through yearlong classes and
							private study with faculty in 92NY&rsquo;s School of the Arts,
							Music, and Dance. 92NY covers all costs associated with classes
							and private study.
						</p>

						<h5>College- and Career-Readiness</h5>

						<p>
							Teen Producers work one-on-one with a college advisor during the
							college identification and application process, helping them
							through the financial aid process, the Common Application, and
							their personal statements. Participating teens also explore career
							readiness best practices through supplementary workshops and
							opportunities.
						</p>

						<h5>Attendance at Cultural Arts Events</h5>

						<p>
							Teen Producers attend a range of performances and exhibitions at
							92NY and other NYC-based arts organizations. 92NY covers all costs
							associated with attendance at events, including tickets and
							transportation.
						</p>

						<h5>Culminating Production &mdash; Teen Arts Week</h5>

						<p>
							Teen Producers will use their respective knowledge, strengths, and
							skill sets to help produce <em>Teen Arts Week</em>, NYC&rsquo;s
							annual citywide celebration of the arts &mdash; for teens, by
							teens &mdash; including the Teen Arts Week Kickoff Event at 92NY.

										<p>
											<strong>Patricia (0:01):</strong> We are back on
											&quot;Digital Edition New York&quot;. Despite the fact
											that it is sometimes considered the art capitol of the
											world, New York sometimes lacks diverse representation.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Rafael (0:11):</strong> This may change because
											92Y&rsquo;s program seeks to change the perspective. To
											learn more we have Ricardo Maldonado, who is the program
											director of poetry and Susan Domínguez who is a student
											participant in this initiative. Welcome! Tell us what this
											is all about?
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Ricardo (0:32): </strong> Well, 92Y is a cultural
											center in the Upper East Side. We have been there for more
											than 140 years and have had programs for our community and
											for the world. The program, &ldquo;Teen Producers&rdquo;,
											is for Bronx public school students, where they work with
											us in a professional exploration program in which they are
											also able to develop their talents.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Patricia (1:02):</strong> How great! Susan, you
											are a participant and an example of what this program has
											achieved on a cultural level. Tell us about your
											experience.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Susan (1:10):</strong> My experience in the
											program has been great, because it has helped me to have
											an appreciation for what has to happen before going on
											stage.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Rafael (1:23):</strong> Basically, it&rsquo;s as
											if it were a preliminary preparation so that when we
											arrive at the stage we know what the challenges are, and
											the preparation you have to do.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Ricardo (1:34):</strong> Exactly! For example,
											Susan comes every week and she works with the sales
											department, promotions and marketing. We are creating a
											program that in one week&mdash;two weeks is your own.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Patricia (1:51):</strong> But it&rsquo;s not only
											acting, its music, its all types of beautiful poetry.
											Having poetry, and bringing children closer to poetry, it
											seems amazing. How would I, if I lived in the Bronx, get
											in contact with you all?
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Ricardo (2:05):</strong> That&rsquo;s a great
											question! The program works with certain schools that are
											collaborating with us. They talk with their teachers and
											request to join the program.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Rafael (2:16):</strong> Only specific schools?
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Ricardo (2:19):</strong> Yes, only certain
											schools.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Rafael (2:20):</strong> And all of the schools
											have the same benefits?
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Ricardo (2:22):</strong> Yes, they all have the
											same program.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Rafael (2:23):</strong> And how much does it cost?
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Ricardo (2:24):</strong> It does not cost anyone,
											anything! And it is for communities in need.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Rafael (2:28):</strong> Really, they should take
											advantage of this program because it is free. So, to know
											which schools are participating is there a page?
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Ricardo (2:34):</strong> Yes, you can visit our
											website, 92Y.org/edoutreach.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Patricia (2:40):</strong> I suppose, that there
											we&rsquo;ll find all the requirements and information for
											those who want to know more. Thank you very much for this
											initiative that is so great and helpful to our children to
											learn about the art, poetry, music and culture.
										</p>

										<p><strong>Ricardo (2:48):</strong> Thank you!</p>
